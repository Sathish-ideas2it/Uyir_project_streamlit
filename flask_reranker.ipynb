In addition to the numerous vitamins they offer, green juices are also wonderful sources of chlorophyll, a green pigment contained in plants.

Juices are an excellent way to boost energy any time of day! Green juices should be primarily composed of vegetables with some fruit like green apples for flavor. Using a specialized juicer, known as a masticating juicer that “chews” the vegetables instead of cutting them, you can make yourself a batch of juice that can be sipped all day.
